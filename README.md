# tfgFrontend

In this project, I create a **multiplatform web application** for primary care centers in Spain. On this website you can search for a patient, take a look at their medical history, create visits, and generate patient lists. To create the frontend, I have used principally **React**, using advanced concepts such as **React Context** and **Custom Hooks**. Also, I used **Axios** to made the requet to my **APIRest**, and **Postman** to check the backend funcionalities. Last but not least, I used **Cypress** to test the funcionalities.

Here's only the frontend code of my TFG. If you want see how backend works, go to https://github.com/nuriia99/tfgBackend
